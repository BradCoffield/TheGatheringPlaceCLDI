          <p>
            We believe that the Bible is the divinely inspired Word of God. It is God’s revelation of Himself to Mankind. Therefore, the Bible is Truth and is our authority in all matters of life and ministry. (1 Thessalonians 2:13, 2 Timothy 3:16-17, and 2 Peter 1:12)
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe in God revealed in three persons. We believe God is our Creator, and therefore, we are accountable to Him. We believe in God who is both equally and completely loving and holy. (Acts 17:24-27, Exodus 34:6-7, and 1 John 4:6)
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that sin entered the world through the Fall of Adam and Eve. We believe that all mankind is conceived and born in this lost and fallen state. We believe that the result of this sin is death and eternal separation from God, our Creator. (Genesis 3:1-6, Romans 5:12, 1 John 1:8, Romans 3:23, Hebrews 9:27, Romans 6:23, Matthew 25:32-33, 41)
          </p>
<p>
  We believe in the deity of Jesus Christ, His virgin birth, sinless life, death, bodily resurrection, personal return and present exaltation at God’s right hand. (John 1:1-17, 1 John 3:5, Mark 16:19, Acts 1:11)
</p>
<p>
  We believe in the resurrection of the saved to everlasting life and joy in heaven and the resurrection of the unsaved unto everlasting punishment. (Matthew 25:32-41, 2 Thessalonians 1:5-10, Revelation 20:15, Revelation 21:4)
</p>
<p>
  We believe in salvation from God’s punishment and to eternal life by God’s grace through faith in the perfect life, substitutionary death, and shed blood of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. (1 Peter 1:18-19, 1 Corinthians 15: 3, 1 Peter 3:18)
</p>
<p>
  We believe that God’s great call and commission to His people is to live lives obedient to His Word and to go into all the world to preach the Good News of Jesus Christ to all people, baptizing and discipling all those who believe. (Matthew 28:19-20, Acts 1:8, 1 Thessalonians 4:1-7, 1 Peter 2:9)
</p>
<p>
  We believe that God created and sanctioned marriage to bring together men and women, the complementary halves of humanity, by joining them in “one-flesh” unions. (Gen 2:18-25.) Additionally, we believe marriage is between one man and one woman for life and uniquely reflects Christ’s relationship with His Church. (Ephesians 5:21-33)
</p>
<p>
  We believe God wonderfully and immutably creates each person as male or female, and these distinct, complementary genders together reflect the image and nature of God. (Genesis 1:26-27)
</p>
<p>
  We believe that all human life is sacred and created by God in His image. Human life is of inestimable worth in all its dimensions, including pre-born babies, the aged, the physically or mentally challenged, and every other stage or condition from conception through natural death. We are therefore called to defend, protect, and value all human life. (Psalm 139)
