          <h3>The Gathering Place</h3>
          <p>
            The Gathering Place has been welcoming guests since July of 2018. Before its grand opening, The Gathering Place was once commonly recognized as the Labor Temple building located at 24 S. 29th Street. The transformation of the building was called Project Katapheugó, A work of Community Leadership & Development, Inc. (CLDI) to reclaim, restore, and promote community renewal. The Gathering Place, located in what is now the new CLDI building and under the nonprofit of the organization, would not be here without the abundant blessing and provision from God through amazing donors throughout our community and beyond. In response, we are dedicated to providing the beautiful venue to our community for an affordable price, understanding that all the profits will cycle back into our efforts to rebuild lives, restore families, and re-neighboring communities through CLDI’s various areas of ministry.

           <h3>CLDI Brief History</h3>
           <p>
            Community Leadership & Development, Inc. (CLDI) is a faith-based 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that has been working since 1981 to invest in and foster transformation in Billings’ oldest and most marginalized community, the South Side.  Our mission is to seek transformed lives through the gospel by rebuilding lives, restoring families, and re-neighboring communities. Our work has included: job-skill training for men coming out of prison; building and offer quality, affordable housing to persons in need; life-skill training and development for older teens and adults in order to help advance career opportunities; work with pregnant and parenting teenage moms to counsel them, as well as women exiting incarceration and drug abuse; provide HiSet guidance and financial coaching; and lastly, staff and volunteers to work with at-risk youth, family members, partner organizations, and schools serving the South Side.  A core belief of CLDI is that all people have Imago Dei (meaning they have been in the image of God), therefore, all people have intrinsic value and worth.  Driven by this belief, CLDI intentionally engages those we serve in relationship to emphasize dignity, hope, and cast vision for living life to one’s fullest potential.  We believe that through this relational investment, change is obtainable and that such change will greatly impact individuals, families, thus, communities and the city as a whole.
