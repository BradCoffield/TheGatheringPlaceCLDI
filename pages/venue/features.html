<h3>Catering Kitchen</h3>
<p>
  A full-range commercial oven, warmer, refrigerator, freezer, sink, and
  stainless steel counter space fully equips this kitchen for both licensed
  caterers and do-it-yourselfers. Limited knives, serving utensils, coffee and
  water urns, and cutting boards are also available to our clients for no
  additional charge.
</p>

<h3>Tables & Chairs</h3>
<p>
  We are happy to offer ten 60-inch rounds, four 8-foot longs, four 6-foot
  longs, two thin 6-foot longs, three cocktail tables, and 110 folding chairs to
  our guests. We do not charge extra for use of table and chairs, however, the
  renter is responsible for set up and tear down.
</p>

<h3>Gallery Hanging Wall</h3>
<p>
  We believe every event should be customized to you. Easily decorate the
  neutral white walls with pictures, flowers, frames, fabric, etc. using our
  gallery hanging system. Located on the north wall of the space, the
  easy-to-use hanging wall is sure to make your Pinterest board ideas come to
  life.
</p>

<h3>A/V Equipment</h3>
<p>
  We are fully equipped with a sound system including a high-quality projector,
  motorized projector screen, soundboard and speakers. If you do choose to use
  the equipment for no additional cost, a how-to guide and run-through is
  available prior to your event to guarantee your event goes smoothly. During
  the event, the client is responsible for operating the AV equipment.

<h3>
  Bridal Suites
</h3>
<p>
  We are so excited to soon be offering bridal suites to our guest. Located right underneath The Gathering Place, the separate bridal suites will provide the wedding parties a beautiful, secluded area to get ready for the big day. Also downstairs will be a small kitchenette and seating for the bridal party and family to gather before heading upstairs for the reception and/or ceremony. Use of this space is offered to our guests at no additional charge. Construction is estimated to be complete by Fall 2019.
