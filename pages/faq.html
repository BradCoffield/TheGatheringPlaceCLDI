          <h3>Can I have alcohol?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, you may! We do require all alcohol to be served by a licensed bartender, however. That being said, no outside alcohol is allowed. 
          </p>
          <h3>Is parking available?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, plenty! In addition to limited parking in the lot directly behind our building and surrounding street parking, we have parking available in the old Salvation Army lot kiddy corner to our building as well as parking across the street from us at the old gas station. A parking map can be found below.

          <h3> Do you have linens?</h3>
          <p>
            No, we do not! However, we would be happy to refer you to some great rental-company contacts here in town who provide beautiful linens at an affordable cost.

          <h3>What do you charge? </h3>
          <p>Our focus is not profitability, but sustainability. We understand that the sheer fact that this building exists is a miracle. We believe that God asks us to steward our resources wisely and to be joyfully generous, therefore, our desire is to be obedient. We would love to talk about your budget, give you a tour of the space, and host your event for an affordable cost. We do offer a non-profit and weekday discount. </p>
