										<h3>Simple Elegance</h3>

									<p>   Whether you dream of a lavish
											banquet, glamorous wedding
											or intimate get-together, The Gathering
											Place invites you to take full advantage
											of 2,600 square feet of simple elegance.
											A dramatic 11-foot ceiling complete
											with 1940’s exposed beams enhances
											the space with a raw, industrial look not
											lacking in character or charm.</p>
